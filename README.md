# Goldman Sachs Financial Forecasting and Data Visualization Project
## Objective: 
To Assist a cupcake shop in developing a 5-year business plan by creating financial forecasts, analyzing sales data, and designing dashboards to support data-driven decision-making.

### Problem Statement
Task was to create a set of assumptions within the Excel based on the information from the client.
To produced a forecast profit and loss (P&L) statement which shows a company’s profit or loss over a particular period (typically a financial year). 
The profit or loss is calculated by taking total revenue and subtracting expenses that stem from both operating and non-operating activities. It lays out revenue, direct costs, gross profit, operating expenses, depreciation, amortization, net interest, taxes and net profit in a logical manner
To ensure that the cupcake shop has enough cash to execute its 5-year plan, we need to forecast the cupcake shop’s future cash flows. This involved calculating the net cash flow for each year for the business, taking into account key operating, investing and financing cash flows. Here any excess net cash flow is used to pay down debt (as opposed to adding to the cash balance).
Ultimately need to show whether the cupcake shop will have enough cash during the forecast period to continue to pay down its debt and maintain a positive cash balance. 


## Key Deliverables:
